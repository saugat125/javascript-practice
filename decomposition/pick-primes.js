// Write a function `pickPrimes` that accepts an array of numbers as an argument. The function should
// return an array containing only the prime numbers. A prime number is a number that is
// only divisible by 1 and itself. The smallest prime number is 1.



console.log(pickPrimes([12, 3, 7, 18, 11])); // [3, 7, 11]
console.log(pickPrimes([17, 23, 9, 42])); // [17, 23]
console.log(pickPrimes([4, 2048, 100, 55])); // []
